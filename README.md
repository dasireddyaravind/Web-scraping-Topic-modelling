# Web-scraping-Topic-modelling
# Airways Performance analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to my  repository! In this project, I had the opportunity to gather valuable insights from customer reviews by scraping a website containing the feedback of 1000 people about their journey with Airways. I utilized Python as my primary tool and Beautiful Soup as a key library for web scraping. The project involved sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word cloud generation to extract meaningful information from the collected data.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: I scraped a website to obtain a dataset consisting of customer reviews from Airways.

- **Python and Beautiful Soup**: Python was the primary programming language used, and Beautiful Soup was employed as the web scraping library for data extraction.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: I performed sentiment analysis on the collected data to understand the overall sentiment of customer reviews.

- **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling techniques were applied to categorize and identify key themes within the reviews.

- **Word Clouds**: Word clouds were generated to visually represent the most frequently occurring words, offering a quick overview of the prominent terms in the reviews.

- **Valuable Insights**: Throughout the project, valuable insights were gained regarding areas of strength and improvement for Airways based on customer feedback.

## Repository Contents

- **Code**: You can find the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data scraping, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word cloud generation in the 'code' directory.
